“No YouTube Spoilers” lets you browse YouTube without those annoying plot reveals in thumbnails or titles. It automatically blurs or hides videos containing keywords you’ve blocked.

Usage:
- Add keywords to 'Blurred Spoiler Keywords' for content you don't want spoiled. This will blur the video thumbnail and change the title to "SPOILER FOR: {keyword}".
- Add keywords to 'Blocked Content Keywords' for content you simply don’t want to see on YouTube. This will completely remove the video from your feed.

Key Features:
- Blur and hide video titles and thumbnails containing blocked spoiler keywords.
- Remove videos from your feed containing blocked content keywords.
- Fully customizable keyword lists.
- Works on videos, shorts, and suggested videos.
- NO data collection.
